# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Using-ML-With-Interface

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and effective
model that will be able to predict the price of a used car by using the Linear Regression
algorithm with better accuracy.

➔ Brand or Type of the car one prefers like Ford, Hyundai
➔ Model of the car namely Ford Figo, Hyundai Creta
➔ Year of manufacturing like 2020, 2021
➔ Type of fuel namely Petrol, Diesel
➔ Number of kilometers car has travelled

Problem Statement - It is easy for any company to price their new cars based on the
manufacturing and marketing cost it involves. But when it comes to a used car it is quite
difficult to define a price because it is influenced by various parameters like car brand,
manufactured year and etc. The goal of our project is to predict the best price for a
pre-owned car in the Indian market based on the previous data related to sold cars using
Linear Regression.

The used car market is an ever-rising industry, which has almost doubled its market value
in the last few years. The emergence of online portals such as CarDheko, Quikr, Carwale,
Cars24, and many others has facilitated the need for both the customer and the
seller to be better informed about the trends and patterns that determine the value of the
used car in the market. Machine Learning algorithms can be used to predict the retail
value of a car, based on a certain set of features. The purpose of this project is to provide
Car price prediction using machine learning without any human interference.

In our day to day lives everyone buys and sells a car every day. Now there are limited
facilities and applications to get an appropriate price for one’s car. Now we use this
application to get an estimate value of the car.

Proposed System:-

Null Hypothesis:

Even though the magnitude of over-fitting has been reduced, Regression trees still suffer
from overfitting even after Pruning. This leads to our following hypothesis.
Hypothesis: Multiple and Lasso Regressions are better at predicting price than the
Regression Tree.

Training and Testing Data:

The data is split into training (70% - 563 records) and testing (30% - 241 records) data
sets through random sampling (seed was set to 2786).

Linear Regression:

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between
a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and
independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear
regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term
is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent
variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.
